Chat API Routes Documentation
=========================

1. General Chat Route (/api/chat/route.ts)
----------------------------------------
Current Implementation:
- Endpoint: POST /api/chat
- Purpose: General math tutoring assistant for young students
- Model: GPT-4o-mini
- Configuration:
  * max_tokens: 150
  * temperature: 0.7
  * System prompt: Focused on helping a 7-year-old student with math

Usage:
```typescript
// Example request
const response = await fetch('/api/chat', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ messages: [...previousMessages, newMessage] })
})

// Example response
{
  "text": "AI assistant's response message"
}
```

2. Quiz Chat Route (/api/quiz-chat/route.ts)
------------------------------------------
Future Implementation (TODO):
- Endpoint: POST /api/quiz-chat
- Purpose: Specialized chat interface for quiz-related interactions
- Planned Features:
  * Dynamic context based on user's quiz results
  * Explanation of incorrect answers
  * Personalized study recommendations
  * Progress tracking integration

Future Usage (Planned):
```typescript
// Example request
const response = await fetch('/api/quiz-chat', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    messages: [...previousMessages, newMessage],
    quizContext: {
      quizId: string,
      score: number,
      incorrectAnswers: Array<{
        questionId: number,
        userAnswer: string,
        correctAnswer: string
      }>
    }
  })
})

// Example response
{
  "text": "AI assistant's response message",
  "recommendations": {
    "topics": string[],
    "resources": string[]
  }
}
```

Development Notes:
-----------------
1. The general chat route is currently active and should be used for all non-quiz related tutoring interactions.
2. The quiz-chat route is planned for future implementation to provide more specialized quiz-related assistance.
3. When implementing quiz-chat, ensure it:
   - Integrates with the quiz results database
   - Provides context-aware responses based on specific quiz performance
   - Maintains conversation history for better personalization

Security Considerations:
----------------------
- Both routes require proper API key configuration in .env
- Implement rate limiting for production use
- Sanitize user input before processing
- Handle errors gracefully with appropriate status codes
